###### Cryptocurrency Mining Tools

Personal scripts used in cryptocurrency mining to address some of the following concerns:

1. Watchdog timers (hardware and software) that reboot the system based on OS health and miner statistics
2. Puppet modules to standardize and streamline miner configs
3. Custom ZenPack for Zenoss that integrates graphing of miner statistics (GPU temps, hashrate, pool stats, and profitability)
   and perform watchdog maintenance.
4. Automatically switch miners to the most profitable pool
5. More to come!!!
